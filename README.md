## How to use
1. ``` git clone ``` the repository.
2. Enter the directory of the repository. ```cd Lunar-Lander-RL``` and open two terminal windows.
3. **Training**: Terminal window 1 command ```python3 reinforce_baseline.py --task train``` 
4. **To visualize live plots**: Terminal window 2 command ``` python plotting.py ```
5. You can change almost all variables by changing its value in reinforce_baseline.py.
6. After completion, the directory will have two new .txt files, two image files and two directories with saved models. Do not change the location of those files before testing.
7. **Testing**: ``` python reinforce_baseline.py --task train --exp_no 1 ``` . You need to change the experiment number 1 to any integer k as it represents the folder in ```Saved_Exps/Test_k``` where all the results will be saved.

## Results
Around 20 experiments were done with varyng hyperparameters and the best result in terms of solving the task - getting 200+ reward for 100 consequtive episodes in the least number of episodes is ```Test_11```. There were some tests which scored more rewards on 100 consequtive episodes than the model in Test_11. Each folder has a ```logfile.txt``` representing the hyperparams value, ```test_log.txt``` for test results, ```reward_log.txt``` for episode logs during training.
